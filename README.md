# Century Bank: Enhancing Data Exploration and Cleaning with PySpark

## Overview

Century Bank, a leading financial institution, faced significant challenges in effectively exploring and cleaning vast volumes of financial data, which hindered its ability to derive actionable insights. This project outlines how Century Bank utilized PySpark to streamline data preparation, leading to enhanced insights and more informed decision-making.

## Challenges

Data engineers were tasked with addressing several key issues:
- Inefficient manual data exploration and cleaning processes.
- Lack of scalability to handle growing data volumes.
- Inconsistent data quality leading to inaccurate reporting and analysis.
- Complexity in transforming raw data into a structured and normalized database format.

## Objectives

The primary objectives for data engineers were to:
- Implement an automated data exploration and cleaning solution using PySpark to streamline the process.
- Normalize the dataset into a suitable database format (2NF or 3NF) for improved data integrity and consistency.
- Load the cleaned and normalized dataset into a PostgreSQL server for further analysis and reporting.

## Benefits

The implementation of the PySpark data exploration and cleaning solution resulted in the following benefits for data engineers:
- **Efficiency**: Automated data exploration and cleaning processes reduced manual effort and time spent on tedious tasks.
- **Scalability**: PySpark's distributed computing capabilities allowed for seamless scalability to handle large volumes of financial data.
- **Data Quality**: Improved data quality and consistency through standardized cleaning and normalization techniques.
- **Structured Database**: Transforming the dataset into a normalized form facilitated easier database management and querying.
- **Collaboration**: Enhanced collaboration among data engineers and analysts through standardized data preparation workflows.
